Alcatel Lucent RANCID scripts

this was an initial test providing some basic support for Nokia-Alcatel-Lucent TiMOS/SROS.
It's not super-polished yet, but should be functional and stable.
This has been tested on a handful of 7750s on 12.0R6, but should work on
7750, 7950, 7450, and other similar boxes in that family.

(update 20171130:
Note that this version should be considered deprecated; native support
was introduced into mainline rancid 3.7, merging these features)
